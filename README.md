# Numerical Methods Exercises
Brushing up my numerical methods knowledge with the book "Numerical Methods in Engineering and Science: (C, C++, and MATLAB)"(ISBN-13: 978-1683921288).
In addition I am learning C++.
Each folder consists of an algorithm, which has been played with.
The algorithms are not optimized etc., the goal was to get familiar with them and C++.
